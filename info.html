            Listening and speaking are natural human abilities. Unfortunately,
            there are many people who do not have these abilities and cannot
            communicate with others easily. Deaf and mute people often have
            specific communication problems and may communicate with others
            using <u><strong>sign language</strong></u
            >, written communication, or assistive technologies. But how many
            people are <em>deafeningly silent</em>? According to the
            International Federation of the Deaf and Dumb, there are about
            <u><strong>7.5 million</strong></u> mute people in Egypt, which
            represents about
            <u><strong>10% of the world's deaf and mute population</strong></u
            >. According to data from the World Federation of the Deaf, there
            are a total of <u><strong>360 million</strong></u> people affected
            by deafness, including <u><strong>32 million children</strong></u
            >. It is also expected that, by <u><strong>2050</strong></u
            >, <em><strong>one in four people</strong></em> will experience some
            degree of hearing loss, with <u><strong>80%</strong></u> of these
            people residing in underdeveloped countries, and they use more than
            <u><strong>300 sign languages</strong></u
            >.

              Translating Signs into Sound By harnessing advanced sensor
              technology and motion detectors built into the glove, we decode
              sign language gestures. These gestures are seamlessly transformed
              into text and then into audible speech. The speech will appear on
              the screen on the left side of the suit and then be spoken through
              the speaker, enabling the silent people to easily express
              themselves and communicate with a wider audience.
