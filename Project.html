            <p>
              When people think about helping others, they often get confused
              about how to do so. This is exactly what happened to us, but
              instead of giving up, we started learning and searching for
              answers. <br />
              We were shocked to learn that 10% of deaf and mute people are in
              Egypt, and the ways to help them are very limited. <br /><br />
              That's when we decided to take action and make communication with
              them easier. After considering many ideas, we finally came up with
              the concept of creating The Sign Suit.

            <p>
              After finding our target, we began working to make it a reality.
              <br /><br />
              We started searching for the right materials to develop our
              project and where to begin. With guidance from experienced
              mentors, we identified the correct materials and started
              purchasing the hardware.
              <br /><br />
              Now that we have all the hardware, we've encountered a problem -
              <strong> it doesn't do anything.</strong>

            <br />
            <p>
              To get the project up and running, we needed to program the
              Arduino, but none of us knew how to code. <br />
              Two of our team members dedicated two weeks to learning how to
              code the Arduino, fueled by a lot of coffee and intense focus.
              <br /><br />
              Finally, the project was completed or Shall we say the sign suit
              <br />

            <p>
              The Sing Suit is completed And now its time to release it.
              <br /><br />

              However, we are not yet ready to release it to the public.
              Therefore, our team is currently seeking funding.
